AnchorLayout:
    WIdgets can be anchored to the top, bottom, left, right or center

RElativeLayout:
    Child widgets are positioned relative to the layout

GridLayout:
    WIdgets are arranged in grid defined by the rows and cols properties

PageLayout:
    Used to create simple multi-page layouts, in a way that allows easy flipping from one page to another using borders

ScatterLayout:
    WIdgets are positioned similarly to a RelativeLayout, but they can be translated, rotated and scaled.

    Widgets are stacked in a lr-tb(left to right then top to bottom) or tb-lr order.
